# Python Tkinter Calculator Project

Welcome to the Python Tkinter Calculator Project! This repository contains a simple calculator application built using the Tkinter library in Python. The calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations and will be gradually upgraded to include more advanced scientific calculator features.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- User-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter
- Gradual transition to a more advanced scientific calculator

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the calculator on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/STHassanDev/MiniCalcProject

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd MiniCalcProject
    
4. Run the calculator:
    python app.py


## Usage

- Enter numbers using the GUI buttons or keyboard.
- Click on the operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform arithmetic calculations.
- Gradually, more advanced scientific calculator features will be added.

## Future Enhancements

This calculator project will continue to evolve and include the following enhancements in the future:

- Scientific calculator functions (trigonometry, logarithms, exponentials, etc.).
- Improved UI design and user experience.
- Support for keyboard shortcuts and advanced input methods.
